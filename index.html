    <h1><center>War in Gaza</center></h1> 
    <p><b>"Israeli</b> forces had begun transitioning from clearing operations to holding operations in some areas of the <b>northern Gaza Strip.</b> Bombing was at its most intense over the northern part of the Gaza Strip where orange flashes of <b>explosions</b> and <b>black smoke</b> could be seen as morning broke from across the <i>fence</i> in Israel. Planes roared overhead and the booms of <i>air strikes</i> thundered every few seconds, <i>punctuated</i> by rattling gunfire."</p>

    <p>"While <em>some</em> nations have maintained a cautious diplomatic stance, others, particularly Israel's staunchest allies in the West, have <b>criticized</b> South Africa's move. The US has stood by Israel through the war by continuing to ship arms to it, opposing a ceasefire, and <em>vetoing</em> many <em>UN Security Council</em> resolutions that aimed to bring a <b>halt</b> to the fighting. The Biden administration has <em>rubbished</em> the claim that Israel is committing genocide as <em>"meritless,"</em> while the UK has <b>refused</b> to back South Africa."</p>
